		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			Nodewars is a competitive programming game that blends elements of spacial domination and real time strategy.
			Set in the not-to-distant future, rival teams of hackers compete to control as many machines as possible.
			In this dark future, the only money that still hold any value is a digital currency known as CoinCoin.
			Teams use the networks they control to mine as much CoinCoin as possible.
			The more area a team controls, the more CoinCoin they can generate.

		<h1>Interface</h1>
	</a>
	<p>
		Let's start by getting familiar with the interface. If you're not familiar with programming environments,
		Nodewars' interface can seem a little overwhelming at first, so let's cover each window and what it does.

	</div>
	<p><i>Main Window</i> - Contains other windows, Layout menu can be used to save/recall window layouts</p>
	<p><i>Terminal</i> - How you interact with the world, type help any time you get lost</p>
	<p><i>Map</i> - Show who controls what and where you're connected. Useful in planning your next move</p>
	<p><i>Challenge</i> Details - Once you're connected to a machine the programming challenge you have to solve will be described here</p>

	<h3>Joining a Game</h3>
	<div>
		<a href="./images/nw_game_join.gif" target="_blank" ><img class="thumb right small" src="./images/nw_game_join.gif" alt=""></a>
		<p>
			Before we can do anything in Nodewars, we need to join a game. 
			You can use the ‘ls’ command to see what games are available. Use 'join' to join an ongoing game.
			If you can't find a game, ‘new’ will start a new game and join it. Once in a game use ‘join’ again to join a team.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			There are a number of subtleties in Nodewars but the main gameplay is fairly straightforward.
			Generally a player will connect (con) to a node, select a machine they'd like to attach (at) to, and begin
			trying to solve whatever programming challenge is present at that machine.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Rules of Connection</h3>
	<div>
		<div class="thumb right medium">
			<a href="./images/nw_connecting.gif" target="_blank">
				<img class="thumb right medium" src="./images/nw_connecting.gif" alt="Connection GIF"/>
				<span>(connection routing)</span>
			</a>
		</div>
		<p>
			Each team has a Point of Entry (POE). This is point through which all members of that team access the map. Players can connect to any node adjacent to a node where they control a (powered) machine. A machine is powered as long as it is part of an unbroken chain of machines connecting back to the teams POE. It's simpler than it sounds, take a look at this example. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>
			<div class="thumb left large">
				<a href="./images/nw_out_of_power.gif" target="_blank">
					<img class="thumb left large" src="./images/nw_out_of_power.gif" alt="Power Loss GIF">
					<span>(cut connection)</span>
				</a>
			</div>
			So what happens when connections are interrupted? 
		</p>
		<p>
		When a team loses all of the machines it controls in a node, it is no longer able to route connections through that node. That means that any players that were connected somewhere on the map via that node get disconnected. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Another side effect is that any machines that are cannot route to their team's POE lose power. This causes them to stop producing CoinCoin and whatever feature they may have installed loses effect.
		</p>
		<p>
		Unpowered machines also have their strength reduced to 1 (until power is restored). This reduction makes them extremely vulnerable to takeover.
		</p>
	</div>
	<h3>Mining CoinCoin</h3>
	<div>
	<p>
		CoinCoin (CC) is what separates winners from losers in the world of Nodewars. Each team is trying to reach the CC goal first. Each machine the team controls is able to generate CC for the team and bring them closer to victory, although sometimes it is advantageous to forgo the quick coin in favor of a strategic advantage. We’ll get more into machine types in the Node section below.
		 but for now just note that ring machines are the only one’s capable of mining CC and if a team controls every ring machine in a node and all of those machine’s are mining, production doubles, which can be pretty significant.
	</p>
	<strong>
	Two important details about how CC is generated:
	</strong>
	<ul class="dashed">
		<li>A machine must have power in order to function, this means an uninterrupted connection to it's team's POE</li>
		<li>If all the ring machines in a node are owned by the same team and all are mining, CC generation in that node doubles</li>
	</ul>
	</div>
	<h3>Anatomy of a Node</h3>

	<div>
		<a href="./images/nw_node_anatomy.png" target="_blank"><img class="thumb right large" src="./images/nw_node_anatomy.png" alt="Anatomy of a Node"></a>
	<p>
	Each node is essentially a mini-network of machines. Each node contains exactly one gateway machine (represented by the center circle) and one or more ring machines (represented by the outer circle/segments)
	</p>

	<p>
	The two type of machines differ only in what you can do with them once you control them. Ring machines are the only machines that are able to generate CC for your team, and ultimately win you the game, so while they can also have special features installed in them, player’s must think carefully about whether it’s worth sacrificing the coin. Gateway machines never generate CC, although some features can amplify the power of mining ring machines.
	</p>

	</div>
	<h3>Machines and Challenges</h3>
	<i>Attaching</i>
	<p>
	In order to take control of a machine, you must complete the programming challenge contained therein. When you connect to a node you will be presented with a list of machine addresses. If for some reason you don’t see it or you want it printed again, just type ‘ls’. To attach to a particular machine type ‘at [address]’. Once you connect to a machine challenge details will be loaded automatically into your code environment.
	</p>
	<i>Test/Make</i>
	<p>To test your code (using the custom stdin box for input) run the ‘test’ command in the terminal. When you are satisfied your code works, use the ‘make’ command to attempt to gain control of the machine. When you submit your code it will be checked against a series of tests. A machine has one point of strength for each test it passes. When attempting to control a neutral machine you only need to pass a single test to succeed.</p>
	<p>There are a couple of important things to note about the make command; When using make on a ring machine, it will default to creating a mining machine, if you while like to install encryption instead, you must use ‘make encrypt’; When using make on a gateway, you must provide a feature type.</p>
	<i>Reset</i>
	<p>Dealing with neutral machines is a little different than deal with machines already controlled by an opponent. While a neutral machine requires only one successful test pass, when taking over an enemy machine, your solution must pass at least as many tests as theirs did. If your solution passes more tests, than the make command will steal control of the machine. If, however, your solution ties your opponent’s, make will not work and you will have to reset the machine. Resetting a machine reverts it to neutral status and installs a brand new challenge.</p>
	<h3>Features</h3>
	<p>
	Features allow a machine to have special effects. Some features can only be installed in certain types of machines. If a machine loses power, it's feature will no longer operate.
	</p> 
	<div class="section">
		<div class="half-width">
		<strong> Ring Machine </strong>
		<ul class="dashed">
			<li>Mining (default)</li>
			<li>Encryption</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="half-width">
		<strong> Gateway </strong>
		<ul class="dashed">
			<li>Firewall</li>
			<li>Overclock</li>
			<li>Encryption</li>
			<li>More to come…</li>
		</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<i>Mining</i>
	<p>
	Mining is the default for ring machines. Generates CC for the team. The more remote the node is, the more CC is generated. If all ring machines in a node are mining for the same team, CC production doubles.
	</p>
	<i>Overclock</i>
	<p>
	Overclocking pushes the node’s ring machines to produce more coin, double production for each friendly ring machine. Be careful though, overclocking can occasionally cause a machine to overheat and reset.
	</p>
	<i>Encryption</i>
	<p>
	Encryption hampers your opponents ability to attack machines in this node. Opponents encrypted machines must be reset before an other machines in the node can be attached to.
	</p>
	<i>Firewall</i>
	<p>
	A firewall hampers the opponents ability to route connections through the node. Normally if a team controls at least one machine in a node, that team can route unlimited connections through the node. If a firewall is installed a team can only route one connection for each machine they control.
